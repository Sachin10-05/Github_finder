## Objective
In order to improve my knowledge of jQuery, which I have been trying to learn recently. So, I choose this Github Finder project to enhance my knowlege on this tech stack.


## Description
This application is built using below mentioned tech stacks and moreover it uses `Github API` which is getting called with the help of AJAX request. Also all resources like - CSS Bootstrap and jQuery are used with CDN and are of latest version.
Also this application is fully responsible (for different screen size devices) which is taken care using CSS Bootstrap.


## Tech stack used
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* JS
* jQuery  `JS Library`
* AJAX  `JS Framework`


## Limitation
Unlike the API, this GitHub API requires an authentication key thus for security reasons (because I have not learned enough about the backend side), I have removed my auth. key temporarily so the search will not work on your side. 
Technically, with .gitignore, you can hide your key but any script that is stored on the client side instead of the server side, with a link to a key, is still not very safe. 
Thus, if you want to test the code, you gotta get your own auth key from GitHub and add it to a config.js file.
